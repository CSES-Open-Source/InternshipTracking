## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

**Note**: You may have to restart terminal after installing each environment.

#### Downloading Git (and Git Bash)

1. Download git and git bash by following [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Set up Git Bash as the shell for running command line prompts (in VSCode or directly openning Git Bash)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git -v
   ```
   This should output something like this:
   ```bash
   git version 2.46.0.windows.1
   ```

#### Downloading Node.JS

1. Download **nvm (Node Version Manager)**. Follow the instructions on in [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) for the details.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   nvm -v
   ```
   This should output the version of nvm you installed.
3. Install **Node.js v18.20.4**:
   ```bash
   nvm install v18.20.4**
   ```
4. Switch to the installed version:
   ```bash
   nvm use v18.20.4**
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   The results should be something like:
   ```bash
   v18.20.4
   10.7.0
   ```

### Setting Up the Local Repository

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the origin repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/Opportune.git
   ```
3. Create a **remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add [your-username] https://github.com/[your-username]/Opportune.git
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   The output should be something like the following:
   ```bash
   [your-username]    https://github.com/[your-username]/InternshipTracking.git (fetch)
   [your-username]    https://github.com/[your-username]/InternshipTracking.git (push)
   origin  https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/InternshipTracking.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/InternshipTracking.git (push)
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Open an instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Open another instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
4. Install backend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Setting Up the Local Development Database

1. Go to [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new account (or login to an existing account if you already have one).
2. **Create a new project** and name it Opportune (or anything you like).
3. **Create a new cluster** in this project by selecting M0 as the plan and deselect **Automate security setup** and **Preload sample datase**. Feel free to choose and name for the cluster and select any location that is closest to you.
4. Go to **Database Access** (under security in the side bar) and create a new user for yourself. Make sure to select **Atlas Admin** as your role.
5. Go to **Network Access** (under security again) and add a new IP address. Click on **Allow access from anywhere**.
6. Go back to **Database** and click **connect** for the cluster you created. Then select **Drivers** and set the drivers to **Node.js**. Copy the link provided below.
7. Create a new file in the local repo under the `backend` folder called `.env` and add the following to the file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=[link-copied-from-mongodb]
   PORT=3500
   ```
   Make sure to fill in the `<db_password>` field with the password of your account.

### Running the Backend and Frontend

1. Open an instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open another instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
4. Install backend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
